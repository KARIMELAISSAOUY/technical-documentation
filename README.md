''' The goal of the exercise "technical-documentation" is to enhance the user experience when accessing and utilizing code samples in a technical documentation repository. The task is to add an icon to each code sample, which will allow users to easily copy the code to their clipboard by clicking on this icon.

By completing this exercise, you will be making it more convenient for users to interact with and use the code snippets provided in the documentation. This can be especially helpful for developers or anyone who needs to use the code in their projects, as they can quickly copy it without the need for manual selection and copying.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

Fork the repository: This means creating a personal copy of the original repository, allowing you to work on the changes without affecting the original project directly.

Add an icon to each code sample: You will modify the code samples in the documentation by inserting an icon (such as a copy button or similar) alongside each code block.

Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality: By clicking on the icon, the code in the corresponding code block should be automatically copied to the user's clipboard.

The exercise encourages you to take up this task as a way to improve the documentation's usability and to practice your skills in working with repositories, making modifications, and enhancing user experiences.

Remember to test your changes thoroughly to ensure the copy-to-clipboard functionality works as intended and then consider submitting a pull request to the original repository, so your enhancements can be reviewed and potentially incorporated into the main project. '''
